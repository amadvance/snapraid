Description
	SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays. It stores parity
	information of your data and it recovers from up to six disk
	failures.

	SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, with a lot of
	big files that rarely change.

	Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, other
	features of SnapRAID are:

	* You can use disk already filled with files, without the need to
		reformat them. You will access them like now.
	* All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and to avoid
		silent corruption.
	* If the failed disks are too many to allow a recovery,
		you lose the data only on the failed disks.
		All the data in the other disks is safe.
	* If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can
		recover them.
	* The disks can have different sizes.
	* You can add disks at any time.
	* It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any
		time without the need to reformat or move data.
	* To access a file, only a single disk needs to spin, saving power and
		producing less noise.

	The official site of SnapRAID is:

		:http://www.snapraid.it/

Limitations
	SnapRAID is in between a RAID and a Backup program trying to get the best
	benefits of them. Although it also has some limitations that you should
	consider before using it.

	The main one is that if a disk fails, and you haven't recently synced,
	you may be unable to do a complete recover.
	More specifically, you may be unable to recover up to the size of
	the changed or deleted files from the last sync operation.
	This happens even if the files changed or deleted are not in the
	failed disk. This is why SnapRAID is better suited for
	data that rarely change.

	On the other hand, newly added files don't prevent recovering already
	existing files. You may only lose the recently added files, if they are on
	the failed disk.

	Other Snapraid limitations are:

	* With Snapraid, you still have separate file-systems for each disk.
		With RAID you get a single large file-system.
	* Snapraid doesn't stripe data.
		With RAID you get a speed boost with striping.
	* Snapraid doesn't support real-time recovery.
		With RAID you do not have to stop working when a disk fails.
	* Snapraid is able to recover damages only from a limited number of disks.
		With a Backup you can recover from a complete
		failure of the whole disk array.
	* Only file, time-stamps, symlinks and hardlinks are saved.
		Permissions, ownership and extended attributes are not saved.

Getting Started
	To use SnapRAID you need to first select one disk of your disk array
	to dedicate at the "parity" information. With one disk for parity you
	will be able to recover from a single disk failure, like RAID5.

	If you want to be able to recover from more disk failures, like RAID6,
	you must reserve additional disks for parity. Any additional parity
	disk allow to recover from one more disk failure.

	As parity disks, you have to pick the biggest disks in the array,
	as the parity information may grow in size as the biggest data
	disk in the array.

	These disks will be dedicated to store the "parity" files.
	You should not store your data in them.

	Then you have to define the "data" disks that you want to protect
	with SnapRAID. The protection is more effective if these disks
	contain data that rarely change. For this reason it's better to
	DO NOT include the Windows C:\ disk, or the Unix /home, /var and /tmp
	disks.

	The list of files is saved in the "content" files, usually
	stored in the data, parity or boot disks.
	These files contain the details of your backup, with all the
	check-sums to verify its integrity.
	The "content" file is stored in multiple copies, and each one must
	be in a different disk, to ensure that in even in case of multiple
	disk failures at least one copy is available.

	For example, suppose that you are interested only at one parity level
	of protection, and that your disks are present in:

		:/mnt/diskp <- selected disk for parity
		:/mnt/disk1 <- first disk to protect
		:/mnt/disk2 <- second disk to protect
		:/mnt/disk3 <- third disk to protect

	you have to create the configuration file /etc/snapraid.conf with
	the following options:

		:parity /mnt/diskp/snapraid.parity
		:content /var/snapraid/snapraid.content
		:content /mnt/disk1/snapraid.content
		:content /mnt/disk2/snapraid.content
		:data d1 /mnt/disk1/
		:data d2 /mnt/disk2/
		:data d3 /mnt/disk3/

	If you are in Windows, you should use the Windows path format, with drive
	letters and backslashes instead of slashes.

		:parity E:\snapraid.parity
		:content C:\snapraid\snapraid.content
		:content F:\array\snapraid.content
		:content G:\array\snapraid.content
		:data d1 F:\array\
		:data d2 G:\array\
		:data d3 H:\array\

	If you have many disks, and you run out of drive letters, you can mount
	disks directly in sub folders. See:

		:https://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+mount+point

	At this point you are ready to start the "sync" command to build the
	parity information.

		:snapraid sync

	This process may take some hours the first time, depending on the size
	of the data already present in the disks. If the disks are empty
	the process is immediate.

	You can stop it at any time pressing Ctrl+C, and at the next run it
	will start where interrupted.

	When this command completes, your data is SAFE.

	Now you can start using your array as you like, and periodically
	update the parity information running the "sync" command.

  Scrubbing
	To periodically check the data and parity for errors, you can
	run the "scrub" command.

		:snapraid scrub

	This command verifies the data in your array comparing it with
	the hash computed in the "sync" command.

	Every run of the command checks about the 8% of the array, but not data
	already scrubbed in the previous 10 days.
	You can use the -p, --plan option to specify a different amount,
	and the -o, --older-than option to specify a different age in days.
	For example, to check 5% of the array older than 20 days use:

		:snapraid -p 5 -o 20 scrub

	If during the process, silent or input/output errors are found,
	the corresponding blocks are marked as bad in the "content" file,
	and listed in the "status" command.

		:snapraid status

	To fix them, you can use the "fix" command filtering for bad blocks with
	the -e, --filter-error options:

		:snapraid -e fix

	At the next "scrub" the errors will disappear from the "status" report
	if really fixed. To make it fast, you can use -p bad to scrub only blocks
	marked as bad.

		:snapraid -p bad scrub

	Take care that running "scrub" on a not synced array may result in
	errors caused by removed or modified files. These errors are reported
	in the "scrub" result, but related blocks are not marked as bad.

  Pooling
	To have all the files in your array shown in the same directory tree,
	you can enable the "pooling" feature. It consists in creating a
	read-only virtual view of all the files in your array using symbolic
	links.

	You can configure the "pooling" directory in the configuration file with:

		:pool /pool

	or, if you are in Windows, with:

		:pool C:\pool

	and then run the "pool" command to create or update the virtual view.

		:snapraid pool

	If you are using a Unix platform and you want to share such directory
	in the network to either Windows or Unix machines, you should add
	to your /etc/samba/smb.conf the following options:

		:# In the global section of smb.conf
		:unix extensions = no

		:# In the share section of smb.conf
		:[pool]
		:comment = Pool
		:path = /pool
		:read only = yes
		:guest ok = yes
		:wide links = yes
		:follow symlinks = yes

	In Windows the same sharing operation is not so straightforward,
	because Windows shares the symbolic links as they are, and that
	requires the network clients to resolve them remotely.

	To make it working, besides sharing in the network the pool directory,
	you must also share all the disks independently, using as share points
	the disk names as defined in the configuration file. You must also specify in
	the "share" option of the configure file, the Windows UNC path that remote
	clients needs to use to access such shared disks.

	For example, operating from a server named "darkstar", you can use
	the options:

		:data d1 F:\array\
		:data d2 G:\array\
		:data d3 H:\array\
		:pool C:\pool
		:share \\darkstar

	and share the following dirs in the network:

		:\\darkstar\pool -> C:\pool
		:\\darkstar\d1 -> F:\array
		:\\darkstar\d2 -> G:\array
		:\\darkstar\d3 -> H:\array

	to allow remote clients to access all the files at \\darkstar\\pool.

	You may also need to configure remote clients enabling access at remote
	symlinks with the command:

		:fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation L2L:1 R2R:1 L2R:1 R2L:1

  Undeleting
	SnapRAID is more like a backup program than a RAID system, and it
	can be used to restore or undelete files to their previous state using
	the -f, --filter option :

		:snapraid fix -f FILE

	or for a directory:

		:snapraid fix -f DIR/

	You can also use it to recover only accidentally deleted files inside
	a directory using the -m, --filter-missing option, that restores
	only missing files, leaving untouched all the others.

		:snapraid fix -m -f DIR/

	Or to recover all the deleted files in all the drives with:

		:snapraid fix -m

  Recovering
	The worst happened, and you lost one or more disks!

	DO NOT PANIC! You will be able to recover them!

	The first thing you have to do is to avoid further changes at your disk array.
	Disable any remote connection to it, any scheduled process, including any
	scheduled SnapRAID nightly sync or scrub.

	Then proceed with the following steps.

    STEP 1 -> Reconfigure
	You need some space to recover, even better if you already have additional
	spare disks, but in case, also an external USB or remote disk is enough.

	Change the SnapRAID configuration file to make the "data" or "parity"
	option of the failed disk to point to the place where you have enough empty
	space to recover the files.

	For example, if you have that disk "d1" failed, you can change from:

		:data d1 /mnt/disk1/

	to:

		:data d1 /mnt/new_spare_disk/

	If the disk to recover is a parity disk, change the appropriate "parity"
	option.
	If you have more broken disks, change all their configuration options.

    STEP 2 -> Fix
	Run the fix command, storing the log in an external file with:

		:snapraid -d NAME -l fix.log fix

	Where NAME is the name of the disk, like "d1" as in our previous example.
	In case the disk to recover is a parity disk, use the "parity", "2-parity"
	names.
	If you have more broken disks, use multiple -d options to specify all
	of them.

	This command will take a long time.

	Take care that you need also few gigabytes free to store the fix.log file.
	Run it from a disk with some free space.

	Now you have recovered all the recoverable. If some file is partially or totally
	unrecoverable, it will be renamed adding the ".unrecoverable" extension.

	You can get a detailed list of all the unrecoverable blocks in the fix.log file
	checking all the lines starting with "unrecoverable:"

	If you are not satisfied of the recovering, you can retry it as many
	time you wish.

	For example, if you have removed files from the array after the last
	"sync", this may result in some other files not recovered.
	In this case, you can retry the "fix" using the -i, --import option,
	specifying where these files are now, to include them again in the
	recovering process.

	If you are satisfied of the recovering, you can now proceed further,
	but take care that after syncing you cannot retry the "fix" command
	anymore!

    STEP 3 -> Check
	As paranoid check, you can now run a "check" command to ensure that
	everything is OK on the recovered disk.

		:snapraid -d NAME -a check

	Where NAME is the name of the disk, like "d1" as in our previous example.

	The options -d and -a tell SnapRAID to check only the specified disk,
	and ignore all the parity data.

	This command will take a long time, but if you are not paranoid,
	you can skip it.

    STEP 4 -> Sync
	Run the "sync" command to re-synchronize the array with the new disk.

		:snapraid sync

	If everything is recovered, this command is immediate.

Commands
	SnapRAID provides a few simple commands that allow to:

	* Prints the status of the array -> "status"
	* Controls the disks -> "smart", "up", "down"
	* Makes a backup/snapshot -> "sync"
	* Periodically checks data -> "scrub"
	* Restore the last backup/snapshot -> "fix".

	Take care that the commands have to be written in lower case.

  status
	Prints a summary of the state of the disk array.

	It includes information about the parity fragmentation, how old
	are the blocks without checking, and all the recorded silent
	errors encountered while scrubbing.

	Note that the information presented refers at the latest time you
	run "sync". Later modifications are not taken into account.

	If bad blocks were detected, their block numbers are listed.
	To fix them, you can use the "fix -e" command.

	It also shows a graph representing the last time each block
	was scrubbed or synced. Scrubbed blocks are shown with '*',
	blocks synced but not yet scrubbed with 'o'.

	Nothing is modified.

  smart
	Prints a SMART report of all the disks of the array.

	It includes an estimation of the probability of failure in the next
	year allowing to plan maintenance replacements of the disks that show
	suspicious attributes.

	This probability estimation obtained correlating the SMART attributes
	of the disks, with the Backblaze data available at:

		:https://www.backblaze.com/hard-drive-test-data.html

	If SMART reports that a disk is failing, "FAIL" or "PREFAIL" is printed
	for that disk, and SnapRAID returns with an error.
	In this case an immediate replacement of the disk is highly recommended.

	Other possible strings are:
		logfail - In the past some attributes were lower than
			the threshold.
		logerr - The device error log contains errors.
		selferr - The device self-test log contains errors.

	If the -v, --verbose option is specified a deeper statistical analysis
	is provided. This analysis can help you to decide if you need more
	or less parity.

	This command uses the "smartctl" tool, and it's equivalent to run
	"smartctl -a" on all the devices.

	If your devices are not auto-detected correctly, you can configure
	a custom command using the "smartctl" option in the configuration
	file.

	Nothing is modified.

  up
	Spins up all the disks of the array.

	You can spin-up only some specific disks using the -d, --filter-disk option.

	Take care that spinning-up all the disks at the same time needs a lot of power.
	Ensure that your power-supply can sustain that.

	Nothing is modified.

  down
	Spins down all the disks of the array.

	This command uses the "smartctl" tool, and it's equivalent to run
	"smartctl -s standby,now" on all the devices.

	You can spin-down only some specific disks using the -d, --filter-disk option.

	Nothing is modified.

  diff
	Lists all the files modified from the last "sync" that need to have
	their parity data recomputed.

	This command doesn't check the file data, but only the file time-stamp
	size and inode.

	At the end of the command, you'll get a summary of the file changes
	grouped by:
		equal - Files equal at before.
		added - Files added that were not present before.
		removed - Files removed.
		updated - Files with a different size or time-stamp, meaning that
			they were modified.
		moved - Files moved to a different directory of the same disk.
			They are identified by having the same name, size, time-stamp
			and inode, but different directory.
		copied - Files copied in the same or different disk. Note that if in
			true they are moved to a different disk, you'll also have
			them counted in "removed".
			They are identified by having the same name, size, and
			time-stamp. But if the sub-second time-stamp is zero,
			then the full path should match, and not only the name.
		restored - Files with a different inode but with name, size and time-stamp
			matching. These are usually files restored after being deleted.

	If a "sync" is required, the process return code is 2, instead of the
	default 0. The return code 1 is instead for a generic error condition.

	Nothing is modified.

  sync
	Updates the parity information. All the modified files
	in the disk array are read, and the corresponding parity
	data is updated.

	You can stop this process at any time pressing Ctrl+C,
	without losing the work already done.
	At the next run the "sync" process will start where
	interrupted.

	If during the process, silent or input/output errors are found,
	the corresponding blocks are marked as bad.

	Files are identified by path and/or inode and checked by
	size and time-stamp.
	If the file size or time-stamp are different, the parity data
	is recomputed for the whole file.
	If the file is moved or renamed in the same disk, keeping the
	same inode, the parity is not recomputed.
	If the file is moved to another disk, the parity is recomputed,
	but the previously computed hash information is kept.

	The "content" and "parity" files are modified if necessary.
	The files in the array are NOT modified.

  scrub
	Scrubs the array, checking for silent or input/output errors in data
	and parity disks.

	For each command invocation, about the 8% of the array is checked, but
	nothing that was already scrubbed in the last 10 days.
	This means that scrubbing once a week, every bit of data is checked
	at least one time every three months.

	You can define a different scrub plan or amount using the -p, --plan
	option that takes as argument:
	bad - Scrub blocks marked bad.
	new - Scrub just synced blocks not yet scrubbed.
	full - Scrub everything.
	0-100 - Scrub the exact percentage of blocks.

	If you specify a percentage amount, you can also use the -o, --older-than
	option to define how old the block should be.
	The oldest blocks are scrubbed first ensuring an optimal check.
	If instead you want to scrub the just synced blocks, not yet scrubbed,
	you should use the "-p new" option.

	To get the details of the scrub status use the "status" command.

	For any silent or input/output error found the corresponding blocks
	are marked as bad in the "content" file.
	These bad blocks are listed in "status", and can be fixed with "fix -e".
	After the fix, at the next scrub they will be rechecked, and if found
	corrected, the bad mark will be removed.
	To scrub only the bad blocks, you can use the "scrub -p bad" command.

	It's recommended to run "scrub" only on a synced array, to avoid to
	have reported error caused by unsynced data. These errors are recognized
	as not being silent errors, and the blocks are not marked as bad,
	but such errors are reported in the output of the command.

	Files are identified only by path, and not by inode.

	The "content" file is modified to update the time of the last check
	of each block, and to mark bad blocks.
	The "parity" files are NOT modified.
	The files in the array are NOT modified.

  fix
	Fix all the files and the parity data.

	All the files and the parity data are compared with the snapshot
	state saved in the last "sync".
	If a difference is found, it's reverted to the stored snapshot.

	The "fix" command doesn't differentiate between errors and
	intentional modifications. It unconditionally reverts the file state
	at the last "sync".

	If no other option is specified the full array is processed.
	Use the filter options to select a subset of files or disks to operate on.

	To only fix the blocks marked bad during "sync" and "scrub",
	use the -e, --filter-error option.
	As difference from other filter options, with this one the fixes are
	applied only to files that are not modified from the latest "sync".

	All the files that cannot be fixed are renamed adding the
	".unrecoverable" extension.

	Before fixing, the full array is scanned to find any moved file,
	after the last "sync" operation.
	These files are identified by their time-stamp, ignoring their name
	and directory, and are used in the recovering process if necessary.
	If you moved some of them outside the array, you can use the -i, --import
	option to specify additional directories to scan.

	Files are identified only by path, and not by inode.

	The "content" file is NOT modified.
	The "parity" files are modified if necessary.
	The files in the array are modified if necessary.

  check
	Verify all the files and the parity data.

	It works like "fix", but it only simulates a recovery and no change
	is written in the array.

	This command is mostly intended for manual verification,
	like after a recovery process or in other special conditions.
	For periodic and scheduled checks uses "scrub".

	If you use the -a, --audit-only option, only the file
	data is checked, and the parity data is ignored for a
	faster run.

	Files are identified only by path, and not by inode.

	Nothing is modified.

  list
	Lists all the files contained in the array at the time of the
	last "sync".

	Nothing is modified.

  dup
	Lists all the duplicate files. Two files are assumed equal if their
	hashes are matching. The file data is not read, but only the
	pre-computed hashes are used.

	Nothing is modified.

  pool
	Creates or updates in the "pooling" directory a virtual view of all
	the files of your disk array.

	The files are not really copied here, but just linked using
	symbolic links.

	When updating, all the present symbolic links and empty
	sub-directories are deleted and replaced with the new
	view of the array. Any other regular file is left in place.

	Nothing is modified outside the pool directory.

  devices
	Prints the low level devices used by the array.

	This command prints the devices associations in place in the array,
	and it's mainly intended as a script interface.

	The first two columns are the low level device id and path.
	The next two columns are the high level device id and path.
	The latest column if the disk name in the array.

	In most cases you have one low level device for each disk in the
	array, but in some more complex configurations, you may have multiple
	low level devices used by a single disk in the array.

	Nothing is modified.

  touch
	Sets arbitrarily the sub-second time-stamp of all the files
	that have it at zero.

	This improves the SnapRAID capability to recognize moved
	and copied files as it makes the time-stamp almost unique,
	removing possible duplicates.

	More specifically, if the sub-second time-stamp is not zero,
	a moved or copied file is identified as such if it matches
	the name, size and time-stamp. If instead the sub-second time-stamp
	is zero, it's considered a copy only if it matches the full path,
	size and time-stamp.

	Note that the second precision time-stamp is not modified,
	and all the dates and times of your files will be maintained.

  rehash
	Schedules a rehash of the whole array.

	This command changes the hash kind used, typically when upgrading
	from a 32 bits system to a 64 bits one, to switch from
	MurmurHash3 to the faster SpookyHash.

	If you are already using the optimal hash, this command
	does nothing and tells you that nothing has to be done.

	The rehash isn't done immediately, but it takes place
	progressively during "sync" and "scrub".

	You can get the rehash state using "status".

	During the rehash, SnapRAID maintains full functionality,
	with the only exception of "dup" not able to detect duplicated
	files using a different hash.

Options
	SnapRAID provides the following options:

	-c, --conf CONFIG
		Selects the configuration file to use. If not specified in Unix
		it's used the file "/usr/local/etc/snapraid.conf" if it exists,
		or "/etc/snapraid.conf" otherwise.
		In Windows it's used the file "snapraid.conf" in the same
		directory of "snapraid.exe".

	-f, --filter PATTERN
		Filters the files to process in "check" and "fix".
		Only the files matching the entered pattern are processed.
		This option can be used many times.
		See the PATTERN section for more details in the
		pattern specifications.
		In Unix, ensure to quote globbing chars if used.
		This option can be used only with "check" and "fix".
		Note that it cannot be used with "sync" and "scrub", because they always
		process the whole array.

	-d, --filter-disk NAME
		Filters the disks to process in "check", "fix", "up" and "down".
		You must specify a disk name as named in the configuration
		file.
		You can also specify parity disks with the names: "parity", "2-parity",
		"3-parity", ... to limit the operations a specific parity disk.
		If you combine more --filter, --filter-disk and --filter-missing options,
		only files matching all the set of filters are selected.
		This option can be used many times.
		This option can be used only with "check", "fix", "up" and "down".
		Note that it cannot be used with "sync" and "scrub", because they always
		process the whole array.

	-m, --filter-missing
		Filters the files to process in "check" and "fix".
		Only the files missing/deleted from the array are processed.
		When used with "fix", this is a kind of "undelete" command.
		If you combine more --filter, --filter-disk and --filter-missing options,
		only files matching all the set of filters are selected.
		This option can be used only with "check" and "fix".
		Note that it cannot be used with "sync" and "scrub", because they always
		process the whole array.

	-e, --filter-error
		Process the files with errors in "check" and "fix".
		It processes only files that have blocks marked with silent
		or input/output errors during "sync" and "scrub", and listed in "status".
		This option can be used only with "check" and "fix".

	-p, --plan PERC|bad|new|full
		Selects the scrub plan. If PERC is a numeric value from 0 to 100,
		it's interpreted as the percentage of blocks to scrub.
		Instead of a percentage, you can also specify a plan:
		"bad" scrubs bad blocks, "new" the blocks not yet scrubbed,
		and "full" for everything.
		This option can be used only with "scrub".

	-o, --older-than DAYS
		Selects the older the part of the array to process in "scrub".
		DAYS is the minimum age in days for a block to be scrubbed,
		default is 10.
		Blocks marked as bad are always scrubbed despite this option.
		This option can be used only with "scrub".

	-a, --audit-only
		In "check" verifies the hash of the files without
		doing any kind of check on the parity data.
		If you are interested in checking only the file data this
		option can speedup a lot the checking process.
		This option can be used only with "check".

	-h, --pre-hash
		In "sync" runs a preliminary hashing phase of all the new data
		to have an additional verification before the parity computation.
		Usually in "sync" no preliminary hashing is done, and the new
		data is hashed just before the parity computation when it's read
		for the first time.
		Unfortunately, this process happens when the system is under
		heavy load, with all disks spinning and with a busy CPU.
		This is an extreme condition for the machine, and if it has a
		latent hardware problem, it's possible to encounter silent errors
		what cannot be detected because the data is not yet hashed.
		To avoid this risk, you can enable the "pre-hash" mode and have
		all the data read two times to ensure its integrity.
		This option also verifies the files moved inside the array,
		to ensure that the move operation went successfully, and in case
		to block the sync and to allow to run a fix operation.
		This option can be used only with "sync".

	-i, --import DIR
		Imports from the specified directory any file that you deleted
		from the array after the last "sync".
		If you still have such files, they could be used by "check"
		and "fix" to improve the recover process.
		The files are read also in sub-directories and they are
		identified regardless of their name.
		This option can be used only with "check" and "fix".

	-Z, --force-zero
		Forces the insecure operation of syncing a file with zero
		size that before was not.
		If SnapRAID detects a such condition, it stops proceeding
		unless you specify this option.
		This allows to easily detect when after a system crash,
		some accessed files were truncated.
		This is a possible condition in Linux with the ext3/ext4
		file-systems.
		This option can be used only with "sync".

	-E, --force-empty
		Forces the insecure operation of syncing a disk with all
		the original files missing.
		If SnapRAID detects that all the files originally present
		in the disk are missing or rewritten, it stops proceeding
		unless you specify this option.
		This allows to easily detect when a data file-system is not
		mounted.
		This option can be used only with "sync".

	-U, --force-uuid
		Forces the insecure operation of syncing, checking and fixing
		with disks that have changed their UUID.
		If SnapRAID detects that some disks have changed UUID,
		it stops proceeding unless you specify this option.
		This allows to detect when your disks are mounted in the
		wrong mount points.
		It's anyway allowed to have a single UUID change with
		single parity, and more with multiple parity, because it's
		the normal case of replacing disks after a recovery.
		This option can be used only with "sync", "check" or
		"fix".

	-D, --force-device
		Forces the insecure operation of fixing with inaccessible disks,
		or with disks on the same physical device.
		Like if you lost two data disks, and you have a spare disk to recover
		only the first one, and you want to ignore the second inaccessible disk.
		Or if you want to recover a disk in the free space left in an
		already used disk, sharing the same physical device.
		This option can be used only with "fix".

	-N, --force-nocopy
		In "sync", "check and "fix", disables the copy detection heuristic.
		Without this option SnapRAID assumes that files with same
		attributes, like name, size and time-stamp are copies with the
		same data.
		This allows to identify copied or moved files from one disk
		to another, and to reuse the already computed hash information
		to detect silent errors or to recover missing files.
		This behavior, in some rare cases, may result in false positives,
		or in a slow process due the many hash verification, and this
		option allows to resolve them.
		This option can be used only with "sync", "check" and "fix".

	-F, --force-full
		In "sync" forces a full recomputation of the parity.
		This option can be used when you add a new parity level, or if
		you reverted back to an old content file using a more recent parity data.
		Instead of recreating the parity from scratch, this allows
		to reuse the hashes present in the content file to validate data,
		and to maintain data protection during the "sync" process using
		the parity data you have.
		This option can be used only with "sync".

	-R, --force-realloc
		In "sync" forces a full reallocation of files and rebuild of the parity.
		This option can be used to completely reallocate all the files
		removing the fragmentation, but reusing the hashes present in the content
		file to validate data.
		This option can be used only with "sync".
		WARNING! This option is for experts only, and it's highly
		recommended to not use it.
		You DO NOT have data protection during the "sync" operation.

	-l, --log FILE
		Write a detailed log in the specified file.
		If this option is not specified, unexpected errors are printed
		on the screen, likely resulting in too much output in case of
		many errors. When -l, --log is specified, on the screen, go only
		fatal errors that makes SnapRAID to stop progress.
		If the path starts with '>>' the file is opened
		in append mode. Occurrences of '%D' and '%T' in the name are
		replaced with the date and time in the format YYYYMMDD and
		HHMMSS. Note that in Windows batch files, you'll have to double
		the '%' char, like result-%%D.log. And to use '>>' you'll have
		to enclose the name in ", like ">>result.log".
		To output the log to standard output or standard error,
		you can use respectively ">&1" and ">&2".

	-L, --error-limit
		Sets a new error limit before stopping execution.
		By default SnapRAID stops if it encounters more than 100
		Input/Output errors, meaning that likely a disk is going to
		die.
		This options affects "sync" and "scrub", that are allowed
		to continue after the first bunch of disk errors, to try
		to complete at most their operations.
		Instead, "check" and "fix" always stop at the first error.

	-S, --start BLKSTART
		Starts the processing from the specified
		block number. It could be useful to retry to check
		or fix some specific block, in case of a damaged disk.
		It's present mainly for advanced manual recovering.

	-B, --count BLKCOUNT
		Processes only the specified number of blocks.
		It's present mainly for advanced manual recovering.

	-C, --gen-conf CONTENT_FILE
		Generates a dummy configuration file from an existing
		content file.
		The configuration file is written in the standard output,
		and it doesn't overwrite an existing one.
		This configuration file also contains the information
		needed to reconstruct the disk mount points, in case you
		lose the entire system.

	-v, --verbose
		Prints more information on the screen.
		If specified one time, it prints excluded files
		and more stats.
		This option has no effect on the log files.

	-q, --quiet
		Prints less information on the screen.
		If specified one time, removes the progress bar, if two
		times, the running operations, three times, the info
		messages, four times the status messages.
		Fatal errors are always printed on the screen.
		This option has no effect on the log files.

	-H, --help
		Prints a short help screen.

	-V, --version
		Prints the program version.

Configuration
	SnapRAID requires a configuration file to know where your disk array
	is located, and where storing the parity information.

	In Unix it's used the file "/usr/local/etc/snapraid.conf" if it exists,
	or "/etc/snapraid.conf" otherwise.
	In Windows it's used the file "snapraid.conf" in the same
	directory of "snapraid.exe".

	It should contain the following options (case sensitive):

  parity FILE [,FILE] ...
	Defines the files to use to store the parity information.
	The parity enables the protection from a single disk
	failure, like RAID5.

	You can specify multiples files that should be in different disks.
	When a file cannot grow anymore, the next one is used.
	The total space available must be as big as the biggest data disk in
	the array.

	You can add additional parity files at later time, but you
	cannot reorder or remove them.

	Leaving the parity disks reserved for parity ensures that
	it doesn't get fragmented, improving the performance.

	In Windows 256 MB are left unused in each disk to avoid the
	warning about full disks.

	This option is mandatory and it can be used only one time.

  (2,3,4,5,6)-parity FILE [,FILE] ...
	Defines the files to use to store extra parity information.

	For each parity specified, one additional level of protection
	is enabled:

	* 2-parity enables RAID6 dual parity.
	* 3-parity enables triple parity
	* 4-parity enables quad (four) parity
	* 5-parity enables penta (five) parity
	* 6-parity enables hexa (six) parity

	Each parity level requires the presence of all the previous parity
	levels.

	The same considerations of the 'parity' option apply.

	These options are optional and they can be used only one time.

  z-parity FILE [,FILE] ...
	Defines an alternate file and format to store the triple parity.

	This option is an alternative at '3-parity' mainly intended for
	low-end CPUs like ARM or AMD Phenom, Athlon and Opteron that don't
	support the SSSE3 instructions set. In such cases it provides
	a better performance.

	This format is similar, but faster, at the one used by the ZFS RAIDZ3.
	Like ZFS, it doesn't work beyond triple parity.

	When using '3-parity' you will be warned if it's recommended to use
	the 'z-parity' format for a performance improvement.

	It's possible to convert from one format to another, adjusting
	the configuration file with the wanted z-parity or 3-parity file,
	and using 'fix' to recreate it.

  content FILE
	Defines the file to use to store the list and check-sums of all the
	files present in your disk array.

	It can be placed in the disk used to store data, parity, or
	any other disk available.
	If you use a data disk, this file is automatically excluded
	from the "sync" process.

	This option is mandatory and it can be used more times to save
	more copies of the same files.

	You have to store at least one copy for each parity disk used
	plus one. Using some more doesn't hurt.

  data NAME DIR
	Defines the name and the mount point of the data disks of
	the array. NAME is used to identify the disk, and it must
	be unique. DIR is the mount point of the disk in the
	file-system.

	You can change the mount point as you like, as long you
	keep the NAME fixed.

	You should use one option for each data disk of the array.

	You can rename later a disk, changing the NAME directly
	in the configuration file, and then run a 'sync' command.
	In the rename case, the association is done using the stored
	UUID of the disks.

  nohidden
	Excludes all the hidden files and directory.
	In Unix hidden files are the ones starting with ".".
	In Windows they are the ones with the hidden attribute.

  exclude/include PATTERN
	Defines the file or directory patterns to exclude and include
	in the sync process.
	All the patterns are processed in the specified order.

	If the first pattern that matches is an "exclude" one, the file
	is excluded. If it's an "include" one, the file is included.
	If no pattern matches, the file is excluded if the last pattern
	specified is an "include", or included if the last pattern
	specified is an "exclude".

	See the PATTERN section for more details in the pattern
	specifications.

	This option can be used many times.

  blocksize SIZE_IN_KIBIBYTES
	Defines the basic block size in kibi bytes of the parity.
	One kibi bytes is 1024 bytes.

	The default blocksize is 256 and it should work for most cases.

	WARNING! This option is for experts only, and it's highly
	recommended to not change it. To change again this value in
	future you'll have to recreate the whole parity!

	A reason to use a different blocksize is if you have a lot of small
	files. In the order of many millions.

	For each file, even of few bytes, a whole block of parity is allocated,
	and with many files this may result in a lot of unused parity space.
	And when you completely fill the parity disk, you are not
	allowed to add more files in the data disks.
	Anyway, the wasted parity doesn't sum between data disks. Wasted space
	resulting from a high number of files in a data disk, limits only
	the amount of data in such data disk and not in others.

	As approximation, you can assume that half of the block size is
	wasted for each file. For example, with 100000 files and a 256 KiB
	block size, you are going to waste 13 GB of parity, that may result
	in 13 GB less space available in the data disk.

	You can get the amount of wasted space in each disk using "status".
	This is the amount of space that you must leave free in the data
	disks, or use for files not included in the array.
	If this value is negative, it means that your are near to fill
	the parity, and it represents the space you can still waste.

	To avoid the problem, you can use a bigger partition for parity.
	For example, if you have the parity partition bigger than 13 GB
	than data disks, you have enough extra space to handle up to 100000
	files in each data disk.

	A trick to get a bigger parity partition in Linux, is to format it
	with the command:

		:mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -T largefile4 DEVICE

	This results in about 1.5% of extra space. Meaning about 60 GB for
	a 4 TB disk, that allows about 460000 files in each data disk without
	any wasted space.

  hashsize SIZE_IN_BYTES
	Defines the hash size in bytes of the saved blocks.

	The default hashsize is 16 bytes (128 bits), and it should work
	for most cases.

	WARNING! This option is for experts only, and it's highly
	recommended to not change it. To change again this value in
	future you'll have to recreate the whole parity!

	A reason to use a different hashsize is if your system has
	small memory. As a rule of thumb SnapRAID usually requires
	1 GiB of RAM memory for each 16 TB of data in the array.

	Specifically, to store the hashes of the data, SnapRAID requires
	about TS*(1+HS)/BS bytes of RAM memory.
	Where TS is the total size in bytes of your disk array, BS is the
	block size in bytes, and HS is the hash size in bytes.

	For example with 8 disks of 4 TB and a block size of 256 KiB
	(1 KiB = 1024 bytes), and an hash size of 16, you get:

	:RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+16) / (256 * 2^10) = 1.93 GiB

	Switching to a hash size of 8, you get:

	:RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+8) / (256 * 2^10) = 1.02 GiB

	Switching to a block size of 512, you get:

	:RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+16) / (512 * 2^10) = 0.96 GiB

	Switching to both a hash size of 8, and a block size of 512 you get:

	:RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+8) / (512 * 2^10) = 0.51 GiB

  autosave SIZE_IN_GIGABYTES
	Automatically save the state when syncing or scrubbing after the specified amount
	of GB processed.
	This option is useful to avoid to restart from scratch long "sync"
	commands interrupted by a machine crash, or any other event that
	may interrupt SnapRAID.

  pool DIR
	Defines the pooling directory where the virtual view of the disk
	array is created using the "pool" command.

	The directory must already exist.

  share UNC_DIR
	Defines the Windows UNC path required to access the disks remotely.

	If this option is specified, the symbolic links created in the pool
	directory use this UNC path to access the disks.
	Without this option the symbolic links generated use only local paths,
	not allowing to share the pool directory in the network.

	The symbolic links are formed using the specified UNC path, adding the
	disk name as specified in the "disk" option, and finally adding the
	file dir and name.

	This option is only required for Windows.

  smartctl DISK/PARITY OPTIONS...
	Defines a custom smartctl command to obtain the SMART attributes
	for each disk. This may be required for RAID controllers and for
	some USB disk that cannot be auto-detected.

	DISK is the same disk name specified in the "disk" option.
	PARITY is one of the parity name as "parity,(1,2,3,4,5,6,z)-parity".

	In the specified OPTIONS, the "%s" string is replaced by the
	device name. Note that in case of RAID controllers the device is likely
	fixed, and you don't have to use "%s".

	Refers at the smartmontools documentation about the possible options:

		:https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_RAID-Controllers
		:https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices

  Examples
	An example of a typical configuration for Unix is:

		:parity /mnt/diskp/snapraid.parity
		:content /mnt/diskp/snapraid.content
		:content /var/snapraid/snapraid.content
		:data d1 /mnt/disk1/
		:data d2 /mnt/disk2/
		:data d3 /mnt/disk3/
		:exclude /lost+found/
		:exclude /tmp/
		:smartctl d1 -d sat %s
		:smartctl d2 -d usbjmicron %s
		:smartctl parity -d areca,1/1 /dev/sg0
		:smartctl 2-parity -d areca,2/1 /dev/sg0

	An example of a typical configuration for Windows is:

		:parity E:\snapraid.parity
		:content E:\snapraid.content
		:content C:\snapraid\snapraid.content
		:data d1 G:\array\
		:data d2 H:\array\
		:data d3 I:\array\
		:exclude Thumbs.db
		:exclude \$RECYCLE.BIN
		:exclude \System Volume Information
		:smartctl d1 -d sat %s
		:smartctl d2 -d usbjmicron %s
		:smartctl parity -d areca,1/1 /dev/arcmsr0
		:smartctl 2-parity -d areca,2/1 /dev/arcmsr0

Pattern
	Patterns are used to select a subset of files to exclude or include in
	the process.

	There are four different types of patterns:

	=FILE
		Selects any file named as FILE. You can use any globbing
		character like * and ?, and char classes like [a-z].
		This pattern is applied only to files and not to directories.

	=DIR/
		Selects any directory named DIR and everything inside.
		You can use any globbing character like * and ?.
		This pattern is applied only to directories and not to files.

	=/PATH/FILE
		Selects the exact specified file path. You can use any
		globbing character like * and ? but they never match a
		directory slash.
		This pattern is applied only to files and not to directories.

	=/PATH/DIR/
		Selects the exact specified directory path and everything
		inside. You can use any globbing character like * and ? but
		they never match a directory slash.
		This pattern is applied only to directories and not to files.

	Note that when you specify an absolute path starting with /, it's
	applied at the array root dir and not at the local file-system root dir.

	In Windows you can use the backslash \ instead of the forward slash /.
	Note that Windows system directories, junctions, mount points, and any
	other Windows special directory are treated just as files, meaning that
	to exclude them you must use a file rule, and not a directory one.

	If the file name you want to use really contains a '*', '?', '[',
	or ']' char, you have to escape it to avoid to have interpreted as a
	globbing character. In Unix the escape char is '\', in Windows it's '^'.
	Note that when the pattern is on the command line, you have to double the
	escape character to avoid to have it interpreted by the command shell.

	In the configuration file, you can use different strategies to filter
	the files to process.
	The simplest one is to use only "exclude" rules to remove all the
	files and directories you do not want to process. For example:

		:# Excludes any file named "*.unrecoverable"
		:exclude *.unrecoverable
		:# Excludes the root directory "/lost+found"
		:exclude /lost+found/
		:# Excludes any sub-directory named "tmp"
		:exclude tmp/

	The opposite way is to define only the file you want to process, using
	only "include" rules. For example:

		:# Includes only some directories
		:include /movies/
		:include /musics/
		:include /pictures/

	The final way, is to mix "exclude" and "include" rules. In this case take
	care that the order of rules is important. Previous rules have the
	precedence over the later ones.
	To get things simpler you can first have all the "exclude" rules and then
	all the "include" ones. For example:

		:# Excludes any file named "*.unrecoverable"
		:exclude *.unrecoverable
		:# Excludes any sub-directory named "tmp"
		:exclude tmp/
		:# Includes only some directories
		:include /movies/
		:include /musics/
		:include /pictures/

	On the command line, using the -f option, you can only use "include"
	patterns. For example:

		:# Checks only the .mp3 files.
		:# Note the "" use to avoid globbing expansion by the shell in Unix.
		:snapraid -f "*.mp3" check

	In Unix, when using globbing chars in the command line, you have to
	quote them. Otherwise the shell will try to expand them.

Content
	SnapRAID stores the list and check-sums of your files in the content file.

	It's a binary file, listing all the files present in your disk array,
	with all the check-sums to verify their integrity.

	This file is read and written by the "sync" and "scrub" commands, and
	read by "fix", "check" and "status".

Parity
	SnapRAID stores the parity information of your array in the parity
	files.

	They are binary files, containing the computed parity of all the
	blocks defined in the "content" file.

	These files are read and written by the "sync" and "fix" commands, and
	only read by "scrub" and "check".

Encoding
	SnapRAID in Unix ignores any encoding. It reads and stores the
	file names with the same encoding used by the file-system.

	In Windows all the names read from the file-system are converted and
	processed in the UTF-8 format.

	To have the file names printed correctly you have to set the Windows
	console in the UTF-8 mode, with the command "chcp 65001", and use
	a TrueType font like "Lucida Console" as console font.
	Note that it has effect only on the printed file names, if you
	redirect the console output to a file, the resulting file is always
	in the UTF-8 format.
