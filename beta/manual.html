Description
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID is a backup program designed for disk arrays, storing
parity information for data recovery in the event of up to six
disk failures.
</p><p>Primarily intended for home media centers with large,
infrequently changing files, SnapRAID offers several features:
</p><ul>
<li>
You can utilize disks already filled with files without the
need to reformat them, accessing them as usual.
</li>
<li>
All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and prevent
silent corruption.
</li>
<li>
When the number of failed disks exceeds the parity count,
data loss is confined to the affected disks; data on
other disks remains accessible.
</li>
<li>
If you accidentally delete files on a disk, recovery is
possible.
</li>
<li>
Disks can have different sizes.
</li>
<li>
You can add disks at any time.
</li>
<li>
SnapRAID doesn't lock in your data; you can stop using it
anytime without reformatting or moving data.
</li>
<li>
To access a file, only a single disk needs to spin, saving
power and reducing noise.
</li>
</ul>

Limitations
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID is a hybrid between a RAID and a backup program, aiming to combine
the best benefits of both. However, it has some limitations that you should
consider before using it.
</p><p>The main limitation is that if a disk fails and you haven't recently synced,
you may not be able to fully recover.
More specifically, you may be unable to recover up to the size of
the changed or deleted files since the last sync operation.
This occurs even if the changed or deleted files are not on the
failed disk. This is why SnapRAID is better suited for
data that rarely changes.
</p><p>On the other hand, newly added files don't prevent recovery of already
existing files. You will only lose the recently added files if they
are on the failed disk.
</p><p>Other SnapRAID limitations are:
</p><ul>
<li>
With SnapRAID, you still have separate file systems for each disk.
With RAID, you get a single large file system.
</li>
<li>
SnapRAID doesn't stripe data.
With RAID, you get a speed boost with striping.
</li>
<li>
SnapRAID doesn't support real-time recovery.
With RAID, you do not have to stop working when a disk fails.
</li>
<li>
SnapRAID can recover data only from a limited number of disk failures.
With a backup, you can recover from a complete
failure of the entire disk array.
</li>
<li>
Only file names, timestamps, symlinks, and hardlinks are saved.
Permissions, ownership, and extended attributes are not saved.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1 id="sec4" class="manual-title-level-1">
Getting Started
</h1>
<p>To use SnapRAID, you need to first select one disk in your disk array
to dedicate to <b>parity</b> information. With one disk for parity, you
will be able to recover from a single disk failure, similar to RAID5.
</p><p>If you want to recover from more disk failures, similar to RAID6,
you must reserve additional disks for parity. Each additional parity
disk allows recovery from one more disk failure.
</p><p>As parity disks, you must pick the largest disks in the array,
as the parity information may grow to the size of the largest data
disk in the array.
</p><p>These disks will be dedicated to storing the <b>parity</b> files.
You should not store your data on them.
</p><p>Then, you must define the <b>data</b> disks that you want to protect
with SnapRAID. The protection is more effective if these disks
contain data that rarely changes. For this reason, it's better to
NOT include the Windows C:\ disk or the Unix /home, /var, and /tmp
directories.
</p><p>The list of files is saved in the <b>content</b> files, usually
stored on the data, parity, or boot disks.
This file contains the details of your backup, including all the
checksums to verify its integrity.
The <b>content</b> file is stored in multiple copies, and each copy must
be on a different disk to ensure that, even in case of multiple
disk failures, at least one copy is available.
</p><p>For example, suppose you are interested in only one parity level
of protection, and your disks are located at:
</p><pre>
/mnt/diskp &lt;- selected disk for parity
/mnt/disk1 &lt;- first disk to protect
/mnt/disk2 &lt;- second disk to protect
/mnt/disk3 &lt;- third disk to protect
</pre>
<p>You must create the configuration file /etc/snapraid.conf with
the following options:
</p><pre>
parity /mnt/diskp/snapraid.parity
content /var/snapraid/snapraid.content
content /mnt/disk1/snapraid.content
content /mnt/disk2/snapraid.content
data d1 /mnt/disk1/
data d2 /mnt/disk2/
data d3 /mnt/disk3/
</pre>
<p>If you are on Windows, you should use the Windows path format, with drive
letters and backslashes instead of slashes.
</p><pre>
parity E:\snapraid.parity
content C:\snapraid\snapraid.content
content F:\array\snapraid.content
content G:\array\snapraid.content
data d1 F:\array\
data d2 G:\array\
data d3 H:\array\
</pre>
<p>If you have many disks and run out of drive letters, you can mount
disks directly in subfolders. See:
</p><pre>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+mount+point">https://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+mount+point</a>
</pre>
<p>At this point, you are ready to run the <b>sync</b> command to build the
parity information.
</p><pre>
snapraid sync
</pre>
<p>This process may take several hours the first time, depending on the size
of the data already present on the disks. If the disks are empty,
the process is immediate.
</p><p>You can stop it at any time by pressing Ctrl+C, and at the next run, it
will resume where it was interrupted.
</p><p>When this command completes, your data is SAFE.
</p><p>Now you can start using your array as you like and periodically
update the parity information by running the <b>sync</b> command.
</p><div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec4-1" class="manual-title-level-2">
Scrubbing
</h2>
<p>To periodically check the data and parity for errors, you can
run the <b>scrub</b> command.
</p><pre>
snapraid scrub
</pre>
<p>This command compares the data in your array with the hash computed
during the <b>sync</b> command to verify integrity.
</p><p>Each run of the command checks approximately 8% of the array, excluding data
already scrubbed in the previous 10 days.
You can use the -p, --plan option to specify a different amount
and the -o, --older-than option to specify a different age in days.
For example, to check 5% of the array for blocks older than 20 days, use:
</p><pre>
snapraid -p 5 -o 20 scrub
</pre>
<p>If silent or input/output errors are found during the process,
the corresponding blocks are marked as bad in the <b>content</b> file
and listed in the <b>status</b> command.
</p><pre>
snapraid status
</pre>
<p>To fix them, you can use the <b>fix</b> command, filtering for bad blocks with
the -e, --filter-error option:
</p><pre>
snapraid -e fix
</pre>
<p>At the next <b>scrub</b>, the errors will disappear from the <b>status</b> report
if they are truly fixed. To make it faster, you can use -p bad to scrub
only blocks marked as bad.
</p><pre>
snapraid -p bad scrub
</pre>
<p>Running <b>scrub</b> on an unsynced array may report errors caused by
removed or modified files. These errors are reported in the <b>scrub</b>
output, but the related blocks are not marked as bad.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec4-2" class="manual-title-level-2">
Pooling
</h2>
<p>Note: The pooling feature described below has been superseded by the
mergefs tool, which is now the recommended option for Linux users in
the SnapRAID community. Mergefs provides a more flexible and efficient
way to pool multiple drives into a single unified mount point,
allowing seamless access to files across your array without relying
on symbolic links. It integrates well with SnapRAID for parity
protection and is commonly used in setups like OpenMediaVault (OMV)
or custom NAS configurations.
</p><p>To have all the files in your array shown in the same directory tree,
you can enable the <b>pooling</b> feature. It creates a read-only virtual
view of all the files in your array using symbolic links.
</p><p>You can configure the <b>pooling</b> directory in the configuration file with:
</p><pre>
pool /pool
</pre>
<p>or, if you are on Windows, with:
</p><pre>
pool C:\pool
</pre>
<p>and then run the <b>pool</b> command to create or update the virtual view.
</p><pre>
snapraid pool
</pre>
<p>If you are using a Unix platform and want to share this directory
over the network to either Windows or Unix machines, you should add
the following options to your /etc/samba/smb.conf:
</p><pre>
# In the global section of smb.conf
unix extensions = no
</pre>
<pre>
# In the share section of smb.conf
[pool]
comment = Pool
path = /pool
read only = yes
guest ok = yes
wide links = yes
follow symlinks = yes
</pre>
<p>In Windows, sharing symbolic links over a network requires clients to
resolve them remotely. To enable this, besides sharing the pool directory,
you must also share all the disks independently, using the disk names
defined in the configuration file as share points. You must also specify
in the <b>share</b> option of the configuration file the Windows UNC path that
remote clients need to use to access these shared disks.
</p><p>For example, operating from a server named <b>darkstar</b>, you can use
the options:
</p><pre>
data d1 F:\array\
data d2 G:\array\
data d3 H:\array\
pool C:\pool
share \\darkstar
</pre>
<p>and share the following directories over the network:
</p><pre>
\\darkstar\pool -&gt; C:\pool
\\darkstar\d1 -&gt; F:\array
\\darkstar\d2 -&gt; G:\array
\\darkstar\d3 -&gt; H:\array
</pre>
<p>to allow remote clients to access all the files at \\darkstar\pool.
</p><p>You may also need to configure remote clients to enable access to remote
symlinks with the command:
</p><pre>
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation L2L:1 R2R:1 L2R:1 R2L:1
</pre>
</div>
<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec4-3" class="manual-title-level-2">
Undeleting
</h2>
<p>SnapRAID functions more like a backup program than a RAID system, and it
can be used to restore or undelete files to their previous state using
the -f, --filter option:
</p><pre>
snapraid fix -f FILE
</pre>
<p>or for a directory:
</p><pre>
snapraid fix -f DIR/
</pre>
<p>You can also use it to recover only accidentally deleted files inside
a directory using the -m, --filter-missing option, which restores
only missing files, leaving all others untouched.
</p><pre>
snapraid fix -m -f DIR/
</pre>
<p>Or to recover all the deleted files on all drives with:
</p><pre>
snapraid fix -m
</pre>
</div>
<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec4-4" class="manual-title-level-2">
Recovering
</h2>
<p>The worst has happened, and you have lost one or more disks!
</p><p>DO NOT PANIC! You will be able to recover them!
</p><p>The first thing you must do is avoid further changes to your disk array.
Disable any remote connections to it and any scheduled processes, including
any scheduled SnapRAID nightly sync or scrub.
</p><p>Then proceed with the following steps.
</p><div class="manual-section-level-3">
<h3 id="sec4-4-1" class="manual-title-level-3">
STEP 1 -&gt; Reconfigure
</h3>
<p>You need some space to recover, ideally on additional
spare disks, but an external USB disk or remote disk will suffice.
</p><p>Modify the SnapRAID configuration file to make the <b>data</b> or <b>parity</b>
option of the failed disk point to a location with enough empty
space to recover the files.
</p><p>For example, if disk <b>d1</b> has failed, change from:
</p><pre>
data d1 /mnt/disk1/
</pre>
<p>to:
</p><pre>
data d1 /mnt/new_spare_disk/
</pre>
<p>If the disk to recover is a parity disk, update the appropriate <b>parity</b>
option.
If you have multiple failed disks, update all their configuration options.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-3">
<h3 id="sec4-4-2" class="manual-title-level-3">
STEP 2 -&gt; Fix
</h3>
<p>Run the fix command, storing the log in an external file with:
</p><pre>
snapraid -d NAME -l fix.log fix
</pre>
<p>Where NAME is the name of the disk, such as <b>d1</b> in our previous example.
If the disk to recover is a parity disk, use the names <b>parity</b>, <b>2-parity</b>,
etc.
If you have multiple failed disks, use multiple -d options to specify all
of them.
</p><p>This command will take a long time.
</p><p>Ensure you have a few gigabytes free to store the fix.log file.
Run it from a disk with sufficient free space.
</p><p>Now you have recovered all that is recoverable. If some files are partially
or totally unrecoverable, they will be renamed by adding the <b>.unrecoverable</b>
extension.
</p><p>You can find a detailed list of all unrecoverable blocks in the fix.log file
by checking all lines starting with <b>unrecoverable:</b>.
</p><p>If you are not satisfied with the recovery, you can retry it as many
times as you wish.
</p><p>For example, if you have removed files from the array after the last
<b>sync</b>, this may result in some files not being recovered.
In this case, you can retry the <b>fix</b> using the -i, --import option,
specifying where these files are now to include them again in the
recovery process.
</p><p>If you are satisfied with the recovery, you can proceed further,
but note that after syncing, you cannot retry the <b>fix</b> command
anymore!
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-3">
<h3 id="sec4-4-3" class="manual-title-level-3">
STEP 3 -&gt; Check
</h3>
<p>As a cautious check, you can now run a <b>check</b> command to ensure that
everything is correct on the recovered disk.
</p><pre>
snapraid -d NAME -a check
</pre>
<p>Where NAME is the name of the disk, such as <b>d1</b> in our previous example.
</p><p>The -d and -a options tell SnapRAID to check only the specified disk
and ignore all parity data.
</p><p>This command will take a long time, but if you are not overly cautious,
you can skip it.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-3">
<h3 id="sec4-4-4" class="manual-title-level-3">
STEP 4 -&gt; Sync
</h3>
<p>Run the <b>sync</b> command to resynchronize the array with the new disk.
</p><pre>
snapraid sync
</pre>
<p>If everything is recovered, this command is immediate.
</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="manual-section-level-1">
<h1 id="sec5" class="manual-title-level-1">
Commands
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID provides a few simple commands that allow you to:
</p><ul>
<li>
Print the status of the array -&gt; <b>status</b>
</li>
<li>
Control the disks -&gt; <b>smart</b>, <b>probe</b>, <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>
</li>
<li>
Make a backup/snapshot -&gt; <b>sync</b>
</li>
<li>
Periodically check data -&gt; <b>scrub</b>
</li>
<li>
Restore the last backup/snapshot -&gt; <b>fix</b>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commands must be written in lowercase.
</p><div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec5-1" class="manual-title-level-2">
status
</h2>
<p>Prints a summary of the state of the disk array.
</p><p>It includes information about parity fragmentation, how old
the blocks are without checking, and all recorded silent
errors encountered while scrubbing.
</p><p>The information presented refers to the latest time you
ran <b>sync</b>. Later modifications are not taken into account.
</p><p>If bad blocks were detected, their block numbers are listed.
To fix them, you can use the <b>fix -e</b> command.
</p><p>It also shows a graph representing the last time each block
was scrubbed or synced. Scrubbed blocks are shown with <b>*</b>,
blocks synced but not yet scrubbed with <b>o</b>.
</p><p>Nothing is modified.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec5-2" class="manual-title-level-2">
smart
</h2>
<p>Prints a SMART report of all the disks in the system.
</p><p>It includes an estimation of the probability of failure in the next
year, allowing you to plan maintenance replacements of disks that show
suspicious attributes.
</p><p>This probability estimation is obtained by correlating the SMART attributes
of the disks with the Backblaze data available at:
</p><pre>
<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/hard-drive-test-data.html">https://www.backblaze.com/hard-drive-test-data.html</a>
</pre>
<p>If SMART reports that a disk is failing, <b>FAIL</b> or <b>PREFAIL</b> is printed
for that disk, and SnapRAID returns with an error.
In this case, immediate replacement of the disk is highly recommended.
</p><p>Other possible status strings are:

</h2>
<p>Updates the parity information. All modified files

scrub
</h2>
<p>Scrubs the array, checking for silent or input/output errors in data
and parity disks.
</p><p>Each invocation checks approximately 8% of the array, excluding
data already scrubbed in the last 10 days.
This means that scrubbing once a week ensures every bit of data is checked
at least once every three months.
</p><p>You can define a different scrub plan or amount using the -p, --plan
option, which accepts:
bad - Scrub blocks marked bad.
new - Scrub just-synced blocks not yet scrubbed.
full - Scrub everything.
0-100 - Scrub the specified percentage of blocks.
</p><p>If you specify a percentage amount, you can also use the -o, --older-than
option to define how old the block should be.
The oldest blocks are scrubbed first, ensuring an optimal check.
If you want to scrub only the just-synced blocks not yet scrubbed,
use the <b>-p new</b> option.
</p><p>To get details of the scrub status, use the <b>status</b> command.
</p><p>For any silent or input/output error found, the corresponding blocks
are marked as bad in the <b>content</b> file.
These bad blocks are listed in <b>status</b> and can be fixed with <b>fix -e</b>.
After the fix, at the next scrub, they will be rechecked, and if found
corrected, the bad mark will be removed.
To scrub only the bad blocks, you can use the <b>scrub -p bad</b> command.
</p><p>It's recommended to run <b>scrub</b> only on a synced array to avoid
reported errors caused by unsynced data. These errors are recognized
as not being silent errors, and the blocks are not marked as bad,
but such errors are reported in the output of the command.

</h2>
<p>Fixes all the files and the parity data.
</p><p>All files and parity data are compared with the snapshot
state saved in the last <b>sync</b>.
If a difference is found, it is reverted to the stored snapshot.
</p><p>WARNING! The <b>fix</b> command does not differentiate between errors and
intentional modifications. It unconditionally reverts the file state
to the last <b>sync</b>.
</p><p>If no other option is specified, the entire array is processed.
Use the filter options to select a subset of files or disks to operate on.
</p><p>To fix only the blocks marked bad during <b>sync</b> and <b>scrub</b>,
use the -e, --filter-error option.
Unlike other filter options, this one applies fixes only to files that are
unchanged since the latest <b>sync</b>.
</p><p>SnapRAID renames all files that cannot be fixed by adding the
<b>.unrecoverable</b> extension.
</p><p>Before fixing, the entire array is scanned to find any files moved
since the last <b>sync</b> operation.
These files are identified by their timestamp, ignoring their name
and directory, and are used in the recovery process if necessary.
If you moved some of them outside the array, you can use the -i, --import

</p><p>This improves SnapRAID's ability to recognize moved
and copied files, as it makes the timestamp almost unique,
reducing possible duplicates.
</p><p>More specifically, if the sub-second timestamp is not zero,
a moved or copied file is identified as such if it matches
the name, size, and timestamp. If the sub-second timestamp
is zero, it is considered a copy only if the full path,
size, and timestamp all match.

from a 32-bit system to a 64-bit one, to switch from
MurmurHash3 to the faster SpookyHash.
</p><p>If you are already using the optimal hash, this command
does nothing and informs you that no action is needed.
</p><p>The rehash is not performed immediately but takes place
progressively during <b>sync</b> and <b>scrub</b>.

This process occurs when the system is under

The first graph shows the number of buffered stripes for each

no buffer available, which determines the maximum achievable
bandwidth.
The second graph shows the percentage of time spent waiting
over the past 100 seconds. The slowest disk is expected to
cause most of the wait time, while other disks should have
little or no wait time because they can use their buffered stripes.
This graph also shows the time spent waiting for hash
calculations and RAID computations.
All computations run in parallel with disk operations.
Therefore, as long as there is measurable wait time for at

Works like -R, --force-realloc, but limited to the specified
tail portion (last SIZE bytes) of each parity file.
It forces reallocation (movement) of any file fragments/blocks
currently stored in that tail section, allowing them to be
placed anywhere in the parity file where free space is
available (including existing holes).
The main purpose of this option is to shrink the on-disk size
of the parity file. If the reallocation successfully clears
the entire tail section (no blocks remain using it), the
parity file is truncated, reclaiming the unused tail space.
You can use multipliers such as K, M, G, or T (e.g.
--force-realloc-tail 1G).

Configuration
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID requires a configuration file to know where your disk array
is located and where to store the parity information.
</p><p>In Unix, it uses the file <b>/usr/local/etc/snapraid.conf</b> if it exists,
otherwise <b>/etc/snapraid.conf</b>.
In Windows, it uses the file <b>snapraid.conf</b> in the same
directory as <b>snapraid.exe</b>.
</p><p>It must contain the following options (case-sensitive):
</p><div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec7-1" class="manual-title-level-2">
parity FILE [,FILE] ...
</h2>
<p>Defines the files to use to store the parity information.
The parity enables protection from a single disk
failure, similar to RAID5.
</p><p>You can specify multiple files, which must be on different disks.
When a file cannot grow anymore, the next one is used.
The total space available must be at least as large as the largest data disk in
the array.
</p><p>You can add additional parity files later, but you
cannot reorder or remove them.
</p><p>Keeping the parity disks reserved for parity ensures that
they do not become fragmented, improving performance.
</p><p>In Windows, 256 MB is left unused on each disk to avoid the
warning about full disks.
</p><p>This option is mandatory and can be used only once.

<li>
2-parity enables RAID6 dual parity.

</p><p>This option is an alternative to <b>3-parity</b>, primarily intended for
low-end CPUs like ARM or AMD Phenom, Athlon, and Opteron that do not
support the SSSE3 instruction set. In such cases, it provides

<h2 id="sec7-8" class="manual-title-level-2">
blocksize SIZE_IN_KIBIBYTES
</h2>
<p>Defines the basic block size in kibibytes for the parity.
One kibibyte is 1024 bytes.
</p><p>The default blocksize is 256, which should work for most cases.
</p><p>WARNING! This option is for experts only, and it is highly
recommended not to change this value. To change this value in the
future, you will need to recreate the entire parity!
</p><p>A reason to use a different blocksize is if you have many small
files, on the order of millions.
</p><p>For each file, even if only a few bytes, an entire block of parity is allocated,
and with many files, this may result in significant unused parity space.
When you completely fill the parity disk, you are not
allowed to add more files to the data disks.
However, the wasted parity does not accumulate across data disks. Wasted space
resulting from a high number of files on a data disk limits only
the amount of data on that data disk, not others.
</p><p>As an approximation, you can assume that half of the block size is
wasted for each file. For example, with 100,000 files and a 256 KiB
block size, you will waste 12.8 GB of parity, which may result
in 12.8 GB less space available on the data disk.
</p><p>You can check the amount of wasted space on each disk using <b>status</b>.
This is the amount of space you must leave free on the data
disks or use for files not included in the array.
If this value is negative, it means you are close to filling
the parity, and it represents the space you can still waste.
</p><p>To avoid this issue, you can use a larger partition for parity.
For example, if the parity partition is 12.8 GB larger than the data disks,
you have enough extra space to handle up to 100,000
files on each data disk without any wasted space.
</p><p>A trick to get a larger parity partition in Linux is to format it
with the command:
</p><pre>
mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -T largefile4 DEVICE
</pre>
<p>This results in about 1.5% extra space, approximately 60 GB for
a 4 TB disk, which allows about 460,000 files on each data disk without
any wasted space.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec7-9" class="manual-title-level-2">
hashsize SIZE_IN_BYTES
</h2>
<p>Defines the hash size in bytes for the saved blocks.
</p><p>The default hashsize is 16 bytes (128 bits), which should work
for most cases.
</p><p>WARNING! This option is for experts only, and it is highly
recommended not to change this value. To change this value in the
future, you will need to recreate the entire parity!
</p><p>A reason to use a different hashsize is if your system has
limited memory. As a rule of thumb, SnapRAID typically requires
1 GiB of RAM for each 16 TB of data in the array.
</p><p>Specifically, to store the hashes of the data, SnapRAID requires
approximately TS*(1+HS)/BS bytes of RAM,
where TS is the total size in bytes of your disk array, BS is the
block size in bytes, and HS is the hash size in bytes.
</p><p>For example, with 8 disks of 4 TB, a block size of 256 KiB
(1 KiB = 1024 bytes), and a hash size of 16, you get:
</p><pre>
RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+16) / (256 * 2^10) = 1.93 GiB
</pre>
<p>Switching to a hash size of 8, you get:
</p><pre>
RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+8) / (256 * 2^10) = 1.02 GiB
</pre>
<p>Switching to a block size of 512, you get:
</p><pre>
RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+16) / (512 * 2^10) = 0.96 GiB
</pre>
<p>Switching to both a hash size of 8 and a block size of 512, you get:
</p><pre>
RAM = (8 * 4 * 10^12) * (1+8) / (512 * 2^10) = 0.51 GiB

<div class="manual-section-level-2">
<h2 id="sec7-11" class="manual-title-level-2">
temp_limit TEMPERATURE_CELSIUS
</h2>
<p>Sets the maximum allowed disk temperature in Celsius. When specified,
SnapRAID periodically checks the temperature of all disks using the
smartctl tool. The current disk temperatures are displayed while
SnapRAID is operating. If any disk exceeds this limit, all operations
stop, and the disks are spun down (put into standby) for the duration
defined by the <b>temp_sleep</b> option. After the sleep period, operations
resume, potentially pausing again if the temperature limit is reached
once more.
</p><p>During operation, SnapRAID also analyzes the heating curve of each
disk and estimates the long-term steady temperature they are expected
to reach if activity continues. The estimation is performed only after
the disk temperature has increased four times, ensuring that enough
data points are available to establish a reliable trend.
This predicted steady temperature is shown in parentheses next to the
current value and helps assess whether the system's cooling is
adequate. This estimated temperature is for informational purposes
only and has no effect on the behavior of SnapRAID. The program's
actions are based solely on the actual measured disk temperatures.
</p><p>To perform this analysis, SnapRAID needs a reference for the system
temperature. It first attempts to read it from available hardware
sensors. If no system sensor can be accessed, it uses the lowest disk
temperature measured at the start of the run as a fallback reference.
</p><p>Normally, SnapRAID shows only the temperature of the hottest disk.
To display the temperature of all disks, use the -A or --stats option.

Pattern
</h1>
<p>Patterns are used to select a subset of files to exclude or include in
the process. Globbing characters can be used to match files and paths
in a flexible way.
</p><p>The question mark <b>?</b> matches any single character except the directory
separator. This makes it useful for matching filenames with variable
characters while keeping the pattern confined to a single directory level.
</p><p>The single star <b>*</b> matches any sequence of characters, but like the
question mark, it never crosses directory boundaries. It stops at the
forward slash, making it suitable for matching within a single path
component. This is the standard wildcard behavior familiar from shell
globbing.
</p><p>The double star <b>**</b> is more powerful, it matches any sequence of
characters including directory separators. This allows patterns to match
across multiple directory levels. When <b>**</b> appears embedded directly in
a pattern, it can match zero or more characters including slashes between
the surrounding literal text.
</p><p>The most important use of <b>**</b> is in the special form <b>/**/</b>. This matches
zero or more complete directory levels, making it possible to match files
at any depth in a directory tree without knowing the exact path structure.
For example, the pattern <b>src/**/main.js</b> matches <b>src/main.js</b> (skipping
zero directories), <b>src/ui/main.js</b> (skipping one directory), and
<b>src/ui/components/main.js</b> (skipping two directories).
</p><p>Character classes using square brackets match a single character from a
specified set or range. Like the other single character patterns, they do
not match directory separators. Classes support ranges and negation using
an exclamation mark.
</p><p>The fundamental distinction to remember is that <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and character
classes  all respect directory boundaries and only match within a single path
component, while <b>**</b> is the only pattern that can match across directory
separators.
</p><p>There are four different types of patterns:
</p><div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
FILE
</div><div class="manual-option-description">

<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
/PATH/FILE
</div><div class="manual-option-description">

only to files, not directories.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
/PATH/DIR/
</div><div class="manual-option-description">
Selects the exact specified directory path and everything
inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern applies only to directories, not files.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When you specify an absolute path starting with /, it is applied at
the array root directory, not the local file system root directory.
</p><p>In Windows, you can use the backslash \ instead of the forward slash /.
Windows system directories, junctions, mount points, and other Windows
special directories are treated as files, meaning that to exclude
them, you must use a file rule, not a directory one.
</p><p>If the file name contains a <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>,
or <b>]</b> character, you must escape it to avoid having it interpreted as a
globbing character. In Unix, the escape character is <b>\</b>; in Windows, it is <b>^</b>.
When the pattern is on the command line, you must double the escape
character to avoid having it interpreted by the command shell.
</p><p>In the configuration file, you can use different strategies to filter
the files to process.
The simplest approach is to use only <b>exclude</b> rules to remove all the
files and directories you do not want to process. For example:
</p><pre>
# Excludes any file named <b>*.unrecoverable</b>
exclude *.unrecoverable
# Excludes the root directory <b>/lost+found</b>
exclude /lost+found/
# Excludes any subdirectory named <b>tmp</b>
exclude tmp/
</pre>
<p>The opposite approach is to define only the files you want to process, using
only <b>include</b> rules. For example:
</p><pre>
# Includes only some directories
include /movies/
include /musics/
include /pictures/
</pre>
<p>The final approach is to mix <b>exclude</b> and <b>include</b> rules. In this case,
the order of rules is important. Earlier rules take
precedence over later ones.
To simplify, you can list all the <b>exclude</b> rules first and then
all the <b>include</b> rules. For example:
</p><pre>
# Excludes any file named <b>*.unrecoverable</b>
exclude *.unrecoverable
# Excludes any subdirectory named <b>tmp</b>
exclude tmp/
# Includes only some directories
include /movies/
include /musics/
include /pictures/
</pre>
<p>On the command line, using the -f option, you can only use <b>include</b>
patterns. For example:
</p><pre>
# Checks only the .mp3 files.
# In Unix, use quotes to avoid globbing expansion by the shell.
snapraid -f "*.mp3" check
</pre>
<p>In Unix, when using globbing characters on the command line, you must
quote them to prevent the shell from expanding them.

place <b>.snapraidignore</b> files in any directory within the array to
define decentralized exclusion rules.
</p><p>Rules defined in <b>.snapraidignore</b> are applied after the rules in the
configuration file. This means they have a higher priority and can be
used to exclude files that were previously included by the global
configuration. Effectively, if a local rule matches, the file is
excluded regardless of the global include settings.
</p><p>The pattern logic in <b>.snapraidignore</b> mirrors the global configuration
but anchors patterns to the directory where the file is located:
</p><div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
FILE
</div><div class="manual-option-description">
Selects any file named FILE in this directory or below.
This follows the same globbing rules as the global pattern.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
DIR/
</div><div class="manual-option-description">
Selects any directory named DIR and everything inside,
residing in this directory or below.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
/PATH/FILE
</div><div class="manual-option-description">
Selects the exact specified file relative to the location
of the <b>.snapraidignore</b> file.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="manual-option-list">
<div class="manual-option-entry">
<div class="manual-option-name">
/PATH/DIR/
</div><div class="manual-option-description">
Selects the exact specified directory and everything inside,
relative to the location of the <b>.snapraidignore</b> file.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unlike the global configuration, <b>.snapraidignore</b> files only support
exclusion rules; you cannot use <b>include</b> patterns or negation (!).
</p><p>For example, if you have a <b>.snapraidignore</b> in <b>/mnt/disk1/projects/</b>:
</p><pre>
# Excludes ONLY /mnt/disk1/projects/output.bin
/output.bin
# Excludes any directory named <b>build</b> inside projects/
build/
# Excludes any .tmp file inside projects/ or its subfolders
*.tmp
</pre>

Content
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID stores the list and checksums of your files in the content file.
</p><p>It is a binary file that lists all the files present in your disk array,
along with all the checksums to verify their integrity.
</p><p>This file is read and written by the <b>sync</b> and <b>scrub</b> commands and
read by the <b>fix</b>, <b>check</b>, and <b>status</b> commands.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-1">
<h1 id="sec11" class="manual-title-level-1">
Parity
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID stores the parity information of your array in the parity
files.
</p><p>These are binary files containing the computed parity of all the
blocks defined in the <b>content</b> file.
</p><p>These files are read and written by the <b>sync</b> and <b>fix</b> commands and
only read by the <b>scrub</b> and <b>check</b> commands.
</p></div>
<div class="manual-section-level-1">
<h1 id="sec12" class="manual-title-level-1">
Encoding
</h1>
<p>SnapRAID in Unix ignores any encoding. It reads and stores the
file names with the same encoding used by the file system.
</p><p>In Windows, all names read from the file system are converted and
processed in UTF-8 format.
</p><p>To have file names printed correctly, you must set the Windows
console to UTF-8 mode with the command <b>chcp 65001</b> and use
a TrueType font like <b>Lucida Console</b> as the console font.
This affects only the printed file names; if you
redirect the console output to a file, the resulting file is always
in UTF-8 format.
