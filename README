SnapRAID
========

SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays. It stores parity
information of your data and it recovers from up to six disk
failures.

SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, where you
have a lot of big files that rarely change.

Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, the other
features of SnapRAID are:

* You can use disk already filled with files, without the need to
  reformat them. You will access them like now.
* All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and to avoid
  silent corruption.
* If the failed disks are too many to allow a recovery,
  you lose the data only on the failed disks.
  All the data in the other disks is safe.
* If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can
  recover them.
* The disks can have different sizes.
* You can add disks at any time.
* It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any
  time without the need to reformat or move data.
* To access a file, only a single disk needs to spin, saving power and
  producing less noise.
