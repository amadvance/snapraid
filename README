SnapRAID
========

SnapRAID is a backup program designed for disk arrays, storing
parity information for data recovery in the event of up to six
disk failures.

Primarily intended for home media centers with large,
infrequently changing files, SnapRAID offers several features:

* You can utilize disks already filled with files without the
  need to reformat them, accessing them as usual.
* All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and prevent
  silent corruption.
* When the number of failed disks exceeds the parity count,
  data loss is confined to the affected disks; data on
  other disks remains accessible.
* If you accidentally delete files on a disk, recovery is
  possible.
* Disks can have different sizes.
* You can add disks at any time.
* SnapRAID doesn't lock in your data; you can stop using it
  anytime without reformatting or moving data.
* To access a file, only a single disk needs to spin, saving
  power and reducing noise.
