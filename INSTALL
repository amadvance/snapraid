SnapRAID INSTALL
================

To build and install SnapRAID you need to download the source
code from http://www.snapraid.it and unpack it with:

    tar xf snapraid-*.tar.gz
    cd snapraid-*

To configure and build, run:

    ./configure
    make

To run the correctness tests for the application:

    make check

If this terminates with "Success", you can install the application and
the documentation by running:

    sudo make install

(The snapraid application itself does not require root privileges.)

To start using SnapRAID, change the example configuration
file snapraid.conf.example to fit your needs and copy it to /etc/snapraid.conf

To get more help, see the "Getting Started" section in the snapraid manpage
by typing:

    man snapraid
