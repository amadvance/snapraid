.TH "SnapRAID Log Format" 1
.SH NAME
snapraid_log \- SnapRAID Log Format
.SH DESCRIPTION 
This document describes the structured log tags output by SnapRAID,
which are designed to be used by tools monitoring the SnapRAID
processing state. The tags provide information in an easy\-to\-parse
format, ideal for automation and integration.
.PP
To capture these structured log tags, you must use the \`\-\-log\` option
with SnapRAID.
.PP
You can direct the output to a specific file, or force the output to
the standard output or standard error using the special arguments
\`>&1\` or \`>&2\`. Note that these arguments often need to be quoted on
the command line to prevent the shell from interpreting them.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.RS 4
snapraid status \-\-log \[dq]>&2\[dq]

.RE
.PP
The output tags strictly adhere to the following format:
.PP
NAME:VALUE:VALUE:VALUE...<EOL>
.PD 0
.PD
.TP
.B NAME
This is the primary tag identifier, always a lowercase string
without spaces (e.g., \`summary\`, \`block\`).
.TP
.B VALUE
Following the \`NAME\`, these can be additional sub\-identifiers,
descriptive names (like a disk name), or numeric/string data
values. They are separated by a colon \`:\`.
.TP
.B <EOL>
Each tag is terminated by an end\-of\-line character.
.PP
This document provides a summary of the tags generated by SnapRAID.
For the most detailed and up\-to\-date information regarding the meaning
and context of the values, it is recommended to check the source
code\'s \`log_tag()\` statements.
.PP
When a path is output, it is always escaped using a backslash (\\) as
the escape character.
.PP
The following characters are escaped into sequences:
.RS 4
.PD 0
.HP 4
.I The colon
is escaped to \\d.
.HP 4
.I The newline
is escaped to \\n.
.HP 4
.I The carriage return
is escaped to \\r.
.HP 4
.I The backslash
is escaped to \\\\.
.PD
.RE
.PP
Some tags are output only when the \`\-\-gui\` or \`\-\-gui\-verbose\` option
is used. They provide extra verbose state and runtime progress only
useful for a GUI interface.
.PP
Integer values are marked as \`uint\` when they are unsigned and as \`int\`
when they are signed. However, for practical purposes you can treat
all of them as signed integers.
All integer values should be assumed to be 64 bits wide, regardless
of the signed/unsigned marker.
Floating point values are marked as \`float\`.

to indicate specific issues like \`Command line did not parse\`,
\`Device could not be opened\`, or \`SMART status check returned \'DISK FAILING\'\`.
