                              SnapRAID Log Format
                              ===================


1 DESCRIPTION
=============

This document describes the structured log tags output by SnapRAID,
which are designed to be used by tools monitoring the SnapRAID
processing state. The tags provide information in an easy-to-parse
format, ideal for automation and integration.

To capture these structured log tags, you must use the `--log` option
with SnapRAID.

You can direct the output to a specific file, or force the output to
the standard output or standard error using the special arguments
`>&1` or `>&2`. Note that these arguments often need to be quoted on
the command line to prevent the shell from interpreting them.

Example:

    snapraid status --log ">&2"

The output tags strictly adhere to the following format:

NAME:VALUE:VALUE:VALUE...<EOL>

    NAME
        This is the primary tag identifier, always a lowercase string
        without spaces (e.g., `summary`, `block`, `info_time`).
    VALUE
        Following the `NAME`, these can be additional sub-identifiers,
        descriptive names (like a disk name), or numeric/string data
        values. They are separated by a colon `:`.
    <EOL>
        Each tag is terminated by an end-of-line character.

This document provides a summary of the tags generated by SnapRAID.
For the most detailed and up-to-date information regarding the meaning
and context of the values, it is recommended to check the source
code's `log_tag()` statements.

When a path is output, it is always escaped using a backslash (\) as
the escape character.

The following characters are escaped into sequences:
    The colon - is escaped to \d.
    The newline - is escaped to \n.
    The carriage return - is escaped to \r.
    The backslash - is escaped to \\.

Some tags are output only when the `--gui` option is used. They provide
extra verbose state and runtime progress only useful for a GUI
interface.


2 CONFIGURATION TAGS
====================

These tags report the memory usage and global configuration after
scanning the disk and reading the list of files.

    conf:file:<path>
        Configuration file loaded (escaped).

    conf:missing:
        Operating without a configuration file.

    blocksize:<bytes>
        The configured block size in bytes (uint).

    data:<disk_name>:<dir>
        The data disks as defined in the configuration file.

    <disk_name> - The assigned name of the disk.
    <dir> - The directory entry point of the disk.

    mode:<raidname>
        The RAID mode used. One of `par1`, `par2`, `par3`, `par4`,
        `par5`, `par6` or `parz`. The number indicates the maximum
        number of simultaneous disk failures the array can withstand.

    <parity_level>:<split_index>:<path>
        The parity files as defined in the configuration file.

    <parity_level> - One of `parity`, `2-parity`, ..., `6-parity`.
        This corresponds to the level of redundancy.
    <split_index> - The split index (uint). If no
        multiple split parity is configured, there is only the
        index 0. A split parity configuration distributes parity
        blocks across multiple files.
    <path> - The path (escaped).

    pool:<dir>
        The configured dir to the pool mount point (escaped).
        This is the optional mount point for the 'pool' feature.

    share:<dir>
        The configured dir to the pool mount point (escaped).
        This is the optional mount point for the 'share' feature.

    autosave:<bytes>
        If the autosave feature is enabled, and after how many bytes
        (uint64). This specifies the interval for content file saving.

    filter:<pattern>
        All the active filters with their patterns. These patterns
        exclude specific files or directories from the SnapRAID array.

    filter:nohidden:
        If the no-hidden filter is enabled, meaning hidden files/directories
        (starting with '.') are excluded from the array.

    content:<path>
        The absolute path to a content file being used (escaped).
        Content files store the metadata (like file hashes and timestamps)
        for the array.

    content_parity:<parity_level>:<size>:<free_size>:<split_index>:<uuid>:<path>:<file_size>
        The parity files as stored in the content file.

    <parity_level> - One of `parity`, `2-parity`, ..., `6-parity`.
    <size> - The size of the data in the disk.
    <free_size> - The free size in the disk at the time of the
        latest `sync`.
    <split_index> - The split index (uint). If no
        multiple split parity is configured, there is only the
        index 0.
    <uuid> - The UUID of the disk containing the path.
    <path> - The path (escaped).
    <file_size> - The size of the parity file. Size is -1 if not yet
        fixed, meaning it can grow. This happens for the
        latest split.

    content_disk:<disk_name>:<size>:<free_size>:<parity_index>:<uuid>
        The data disk as stored in the content file.

    <disk_name> - Name of the data disk.
    <size> - The size of the data in the disk.
    <free_size> - The free size in the disk at the time of the
        latest `sync`.
    <parity_index> - The disk position in the parity computation.
    <uuid> - The UUID of the disk filesystem.

4 SCAN TAGS
===========

These tags report detected differences between the filesystem and the
content file. They are output for every discovered change, and
`scan:equal` is only output when the `--gui` option is used.

    scan:equal:<disk_name>:<path>
        A file, link, or directory is equal (unchanged) (GUI only).
        No action is required for this item.

    <disk_name> - Name of the data disk.
    <path> - Path to the file/link/dir relative to the disk mount
        (escaped).

    scan:add:<disk_name>:<path>
        A new file, link, or directory was found that is not in the
        content file. This item will be added to the array in a `sync`.

    scan:remove:<disk_name>:<path>
        A file, link, or directory has been removed from the filesystem
        since the last sync. This item will be removed from the
        content file in a `sync`.

    scan:update:<disk_name>:<path>
        A file or link has been updated (size, timestamp, or link target changed).
        This item will have its content data blocks re-hashed in a `sync`.

    scan:move:<disk_name>:<old_path>:<new_path>
        A file was moved on the same disk. This is an efficient operation
        that only updates the path metadata without re-hashing blocks.

    <old_path> - The old path to the file (escaped).
    <new_path> - The new path to the file (escaped).

    scan:copy:<disk_name>:<path>:<source_disk>:<source_path>
        A new file was found to be a copy of a file from another disk.
        This is detected by matching file size and timestamp, and is an
        efficient operation that avoids re-hashing all blocks.

    <source_disk> - The original file's disk.
    <source_path> - The original file's location (escaped).

    scan:restore:<disk_name>:<path>
        A file's inode has changed but not its date-time and size,
        which suggests the file may be restored from backup.
        The file won't be re-hashed in `sync` as its precomputed hash
        is assumed to be correct.

These tags provide a final count of all detected changes.

    summary:equal:<count>
        Total number of equal (unchanged) files/links/firs found (uint).

    summary:added:<count>
        Total number of new files/links/dirs found (uint).

    summary:removed:<count>
        Total number of removed files/links/dirs found (uint).

    summary:updated:<count>
        Total number of updated files/links found (uint).

    summary:moved:<count>
        Total number of moved files found (uint).

    summary:copied:<count>
        Total number of copied files found (uint).

    summary:restored:<count>
        Total number of restored files found (uint).

    summary:exit:equal
        A zero-argument tag indicating that no differences were found.
        The array is already synchronized.

    summary:exit:diff
        A zero-argument tag indicating that differences were found.
        The array needs a `sync` operation.


5 GENERAL PROGRESS AND EXECUTION TAGS

        message.
    error - A generic error condition that doesn't prevent the
        program to continue.
    expected - An expected error condition. At present it
        happens only when using the `-m` option with files
        expected missing.

        parity data is out of date.
    summary:has_unscrubbed:<uint>

        have never been verified since the last sync.
    summary:has_rehash:<uint>

        update or hash algorithm change.
