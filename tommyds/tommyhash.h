 * Hash functions for use with ::tommy_hashtable, ::tommy_hashdyn and ::tommy_hashlin.
 *
 * This module provides hash functions designed for in-memory data structures.
 * ::tommy_hash_u32 and ::tommy_strhash_u32 use a modified a5hash32, while
 * ::tommy_hash_u64 and ::tommy_strhash_u64 use a5hash (64-bit).
 * Reversible integer hash functions are also provided for 32-bit and 64-bit keys.
 *
 * a5hash32 is intended for 32-bit platforms and uses 32-bit operands with
 * full 64-bit multiplication results. a5hash uses 64-bit operands with
 * full 128-bit multiplication results. Both algorithms pass SMHasher3 tests.
 *
 * Prefer the 64-bit version whenever possible, as it provides better resistance
 * to collisions, particularly with specially crafted inputs. However, neither
 * version is designed to resist deliberate collision attacks. If resistance to
 * such attacks is required, use a dedicated hash function designed for that purpose.
 *
 * All hash functions are intended for runtime in-memory use only and not
 * for persistent storage, as hash compatibility across different versions of the
 * library is not guaranteed. String and sized buffer hash functions produce
 * identical results for 0-terminated strings.

 * The expanded seed is mixed asymmetrically into the two additional state words

 * that skip the main loop and avoids cancellation of either seed state word
 * in the final XOR fold. The resulting hash values differ from upstream a5hash32.

 * \param init_val Initialization value.
 * Using a different initialization value, you can generate a completely different set of hash values.
 * Use 0 if not relevant.
 * \param void_key Pointer to the data to hash. Must not be 0, even if key_len is 0.
 * \param key_len Size of the data to hash.
 * \return The 32-bit hash value.
 * \note
 * This function is endianness independent and alignment independent.
 * It produces identical hash results to ::tommy_strhash_u32 for 0-terminated strings.
 * Compatibility across different versions of the library is not guaranteed:
 * this hash is intended for in-memory runtime use only and not for persistent storage.
 * It is non-cryptographic and is not designed to protect against malicious collision attacks.
