SnapRAID CHECK
==============

The regression test for SnapRAID is run using the command:

    make check

You can also run the regression test with Valgrind using:

    ./configure --enable-valgrind
    make check

To perform a coverage test, use the following commands:

    ./configure --enable-coverage
    make lcov_reset
    make check
    make lcov_capture
    make lcov_html

Then, open the file `./cov/index.html` in your browser to view the results.

Note that the coverage analysis excludes error-handling code that causes
immediate program termination. This excluded code is enclosed between the
LCOV_EXCL_START and LCOV_EXCL_STOP keywords.

To test with the Clang static analyzer, use:

    scan-build ./configure
    scan-build make
